## ✨ Features

### 🕹️ Turn-Based Gameplay
* **Dynamic Player Switching:** Seamlessly alternates between Player X and Player O with real-time status updates.
* **Intelligent Win Detection:** Utilizes a winning-combination matrix to scan for horizontal, vertical, and diagonal victories instantly.
* **Draw Logic:** Automatically detects "Stalemate" conditions when the grid is exhausted without a winner.

### 💎 Modern Neon UI
* **Glassmorphism Design:** A premium "frosted glass" interface achieved using `backdrop-filter: blur(15px)` and semi-transparent borders.
* **Stylish Typography:** Features a cinematic **Montserrat** heading with heavy letter-spacing for a professional gaming aesthetic.
* **Neon Glow Effects:** Interactive markers (X and O) feature custom `text-shadow` glows to enhance visibility against the dark theme.

### 🔄 Responsive Performance
* **Cubic-Bezier Transitions:** Smooth, bouncy hover effects on cells for tactile feedback.
* **Mobile Optimized:** Built with **CSS Grid**, ensuring the game board scales perfectly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **State Reset:** One-click restart functionality that wipes the board and resets the game logic without reloading the page.
